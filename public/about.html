<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, I’m John Shoukry, a Computer Engineering student at Ain Shams University with a strong passion for 
building software that solves real problems. I enjoy bridging the gap between ideas and implementation—taking business needs 
and turning them into functional, reliable, and efficient applications.
</p>
<p> the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in a variety of projects,
from developing CPU scheduling simulators in C++ to designing databases for pharmacy
and museum management systems, and even working on distributed marketplace platforms.
My technical toolkit includes C++, Java, SQL, Spring Boot, web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript),
 and problem-solving with data structures and algorithms.
</p>
<p>I’m particularly interested in backend development and enterprise applications, 
but I’m also expanding into full-stack web development and continuously strengthening
my skills in algorithms, databases, and software design patterns.
</p>
<p>Beyond coding, I value teamwork and enjoy contributing to projects where collaboration and innovation drive results.
My goal is to keep learning, improving, and eventually build impactful systems that scale.
</p>
